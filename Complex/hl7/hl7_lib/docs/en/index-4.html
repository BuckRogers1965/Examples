<P>Under Construction.  I am working on more detailed specifications.
<P>Essentially I am going to develop a very low leverl HL7 library to work directly with the
HL7 messages.  This means that I want to break the message into a data representation that
is most suitable for each language involved.  For C that is the data structure, for Perl
 it is the array, and for Tcl it is the list of lists.
<P>
<P><H4>There will be the following needed functions:</H4>
<P>
<P>Convert a string into the data representation.
<P>Convert the data representation into a string.
<P>Read the elements of the data representation.
<P>Set the elements of the data representation to a given value.
<P>Delete portions of the data representation.
<P>Insert new sections into the data representation.
<P>
<P>Some higher level functions will wrap around these lower level functions to allow us
 to work with the elements by segment name.

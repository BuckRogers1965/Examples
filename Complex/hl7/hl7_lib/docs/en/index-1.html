<P>Health level 7 is a protocol that is used to allow medical computers from different
vendors to communicate with each other.
<P>This is an attempt to produce a simple, correct HL7 library that can be embeded in projects
 to enable rapid development of powerful tools and robust interfaces. I intend to provide the
same interface in C, Perl and Tcl.  If someone else cares to implement the same library in another
language (python perhaps) I will add a contrib section to this package and happily include it as well.
<P>This implementation makes no attempt to implement grammar rules.  I am a big believer in
building a simple system that works and adding to it.  I plan on keeping this version of the
library stable and coming out with a seperate full featured 2.3x version as well as a seperate
3.x version.  Those two versions will most likely be C/C++ only versions.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Changes</A>
</H2>
<P> This is the initial release.  It has no Tcl support, minimal C support and minimal
Perl support. If you are trying it out right now, you are a brave person.  Feel free to tell
me of any limitations that you find.
<P>Currently the focus is on writing a decent specification, the code is just showing
what I have for now.

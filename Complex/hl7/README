This project has the same goals as the original project, but instead it is going to not use a special data structure to store the messages.

Instead the messages will be kept in ascii string fromat and split as needed.  This will remove a lot of management overhead from the users of the library.

The funtions of the library are as follows:

hl7 ("get", $msg, "PID.0.3.1.0")

hl7 ("exists", $msg, "PID.0.3.1.0")

hl7 ("set", $msg, "MSH.8.0.0", (char *)0)
hl7 ("set", $msg, "MSH.8.0.0", "test")

hl7 ("ins", $msg, "EVN.1", "ZVN")

hl7 ("clean", $msg)

Notes:

get
  Get the specified location from the message.  If the location doesn't exist or is empty, return an empty string. Otherwise return the string at the given location.  A present but NULL is returned as a pair of double quotes.  The string returned from this function will need to be freed once the function is finished with it.

exists
  If the location is in the message return a 0, otherwise return a 1.

set
  Set the given location to the given data value.  If the data value is a NULL then blank it without creating any unneeded characters.  If a segment doesn't exist then don't do anything to the message and don't return an error.

ins
  Insert the new segment after the named location.

clean
  Remove unneeded sepatators from a message.

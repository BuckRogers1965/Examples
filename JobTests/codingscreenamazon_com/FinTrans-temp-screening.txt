Use the language of your choice.
Proper error handling is important.
Your code should compile (if applicable) and run.


1) Given a log file with lines that look like this:

1220907563   192.168.0.5   http://example.amazon.com/foo/   200
1220907570   192.168.1.115   http://example.amazon.com/gone/   404
(timestamp)  (IP address)   (URI)   (response)

(see the attached file for an example)

  a. Write a program to print a report of how many times each URI was
  requested each hour.

  b. Write a program to print a report of all requested URIs with 404s,
  and how many times each one was requested.


2) Write a function (not a program) which, given a sequence (your
language’s preferred array, vector, or list type) of integers,
identifies the sequence and returns the next integer.  The sequence may
be:

  a. Fibonacci-like: f(x) = f(x – 1) + f(x – 2)

  b. Exponential: f(x) = f(x – 1) * n, where n is an arbitrary
  constant integer

  c. Factorial: f(x) = f(x – 1) * (f(x – 1) / f(x – 2) + 1)

Examples:

  a. [2, 5, 7, 12] -> Fibonacci-like, next element will be 19.
  b. [3, 6, 12, 24] -> exponential, next element will be 48.
  c. [4, 8, 24, 96] -> factorial, next element will be 480.
  d. [2, 3, 5, 17] -> not a valid sequence, signal an error.

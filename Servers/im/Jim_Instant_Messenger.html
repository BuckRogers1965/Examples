<b>Jim Instant messaging (JIM).</b><br>
<br>
A system that is scalable to millions of simultaneous users.<br>
<br>
This is done with a two way message flow.&nbsp; Once a message is received
it is acked by the receiving system.<br>
<br>
&lt;ack /&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;from&gt;&lt;/from&gt; tags are also always filled in by the server to
keep users from stealing someone elses identity.<br>
<br>
The primary concern behind the entire structure of this messaging system
is security. The server never knows the users password or the contents of
any message. &nbsp; The server also restricts the user from sending messages
to users that they aren't subscribed to, or receiving messages from people
that they aren't subscribed to.&nbsp; The server also keeps the users username,
nickname, public and encrypted private keys, roster and filter rules for
the user&nbsp; so that a user can use any JIM client on any computer and
still have the same access to all their messaging.<br>
<br>
<b>Modular and extendable.</b><br>
<br>
One of the cool things is the ability to connect to services that look like
normal people and download a modual from that service to allow special filtering
and content to be viewed.&nbsp; This allows people to extend services to
any client without having to extend the clients capability.<br>
<br>
<b>Establish connection.</b><br>
<br>
Server gives client its public key.<br>
<br>
&lt;public&gt;&lt;/public&gt;<br>
<br>
Client then encripts all communication using the servers public key.<br>
<br>
Now the the communication channel is established the rest of the communication
can happen is a secure manner.<br>
<br>
This is the first layer of encryption that hides the communications between
the client and server.&nbsp; This includes usernames and passwords.&nbsp;
This also hides who a user is communicating with.<br>
<br>
<b>Registration.</b><br>
<br>
People must first register with a service.&nbsp; This step can be skipped
if a seperate registration method is used.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The client generates a public and encrypted private key at this point and
also passes this to the server.&nbsp; This is part of the users identity
and can never be changed.<br>
<br>
The password that is used to encrypt the user name is never sent to the server.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
&lt;reg&gt;&lt;name&gt;&lt;/name&gt;&lt;nick&gt;&lt;/nick&gt;&lt;public&gt;&lt;/public&gt;&lt;private&gt;&lt;/private&gt;&lt;/reg&gt;<br>
<br>
<b>Authentication.</b><br>
<br>
Once a user is registered then they can be authenticated.<br>
<br>
The user requests an authentication token.<br>
&lt;auth id="request"&gt;&lt;/auth&gt;<br>
<br>
The server sends a random token encryped with the claimed users public key
and that users public key and encrypted public key.&nbsp; At this point the
client decrypts the users private key with the password that it stored. <br>
&lt;auth id="token"&gt;&lt;token&gt;&lt;/token&gt;&lt;key&gt;&lt;pub&gt;&lt;/pub&gt;&lt;priv&gt;&lt;/priv&gt;&lt;/key&gt;&lt;/auth&gt;<br>
<br>
The client decrypts the token and sends it back through the encrypted channel.<br>
&lt;auth id="responce"&gt;&lt;token&gt;&lt;/token&gt;&lt;/auth&gt;<br>
<br>
The server sends back an ack if the token is correct, or a nack otherwise.&nbsp;
<br>
&lt;ack /&gt; or &lt;nak /&gt;<br>
<br>
At this point the user has proven that they are who they say they are and
can do more.<br>
<br>
<b>Subscription.<br>
</b><br>
In order to communicate with other users and services the user needs to request
a subscription. <br>
<br>
&lt;sub id="request" &gt;&lt;from&gt;&lt;user&gt;&lt;/user&gt;&lt;nick&gt;&lt;/nick&gt;&lt;pub&gt;&lt;/pub&gt;&lt;/from&gt;&lt;to&gt;&lt;user&gt;&lt;/user&gt;&lt;/to&gt;&lt;msg&gt;&lt;msg&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;<br>
<br>
The client and server will each put the person in the users roster as a request.<br>
<br>
&lt;sub id="decline|accept"&gt;&lt;from&gt;&lt;user&gt;&lt;/user&gt;&lt;nick&gt;&lt;/nick&gt;&lt;pub&gt;&lt;/pub&gt;&lt;/from&gt;&lt;to&gt;&lt;/to&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;<br>
<br>
<b>Roster.</b><br>
<br>
This is kept on the server and ephasizes the person over the protocol.<br>
<br>
First you define people and then add their methods of communication.&nbsp;
It is the methods that need to be subscribed to.<br>
<br>
&lt;roster&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;person&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;nickname&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/nickname&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;method&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;id&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/id&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;user&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/user&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;dt_last_online&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/dt_last_online&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;pub&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/pub&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/method&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;method&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/method&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/person&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;person&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/person&gt;<br>
&lt;/roster&gt;<br>
<br>
<b>Presence.</b><br>
<br>
You can configure your client to send a presence message to people when you
login to the server.&nbsp; By default this is set to true.&nbsp; The server
should only send offline status to those that you sent online messages and
only if you were disconnected.<br>
<br>
&lt;pres&gt;&lt;from&gt;&lt;/from&gt;&lt;to&gt;&lt;/to&gt;&lt;status&gt;&lt;/status&gt;&lt;/pres&gt;<br>
<br>
<b>Messaging.</b><br>
<br>
This is the heart of the system and the reason why it exists.&nbsp; The body
of the message is encrypted with the receivers public key, because only that
person needs to be reading that message.&nbsp; This keeps the people on the
server from "inadvertantly" reading a message.<br>
<br>
&lt;msg&gt;&lt;from&gt;&lt;/from&gt;&lt;to&gt;&lt;/to&gt;&lt;pri&gt;&lt;/pri&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/msg&gt;<br>
